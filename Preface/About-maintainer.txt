I am a management consultant leader with over 20 years of experience. I have played a crucial role in driving project management initiatives that focus on innovative solutions.

I have extensive experience in global collaboration for start-up and multinational corporations, in a diverse of areas of expertise including strategic planning, organizational modeling transformation, and project management in many different industries, and countries.

I am well-versed in implementing technology and consistently utilizing leadership development and innovation to drive successful processes.

In addition to my professional expertise, I am an enthusiast of Linux. Just a few years back started using Linux when following many of the Linux Community Influencers and the incredible Linux From Scratch project, which have inspired me to do this project.

Kognog LFS is dedicated to the Linux from Scratch creators and collaborators. Thank you for everything you have done for the Linux Community over the years.

I hope you like it!"
